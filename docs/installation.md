# Installation

First, it is recommended to set up a conda environment
```
conda create -n bats
conda activate bats
```

If you are installing `torch_tda` from the development version, please install the development version of BATS.py, install it from source.   

Otherwise, you can use the latest release of BATS.py
```
pip install bats-tda
```
**Attension**: please use Linux OS to install `bats-tda` for now and the support for Mac OS will come soon. 

Now, you can setup with `setup.py`
```
python setup.py install
```
